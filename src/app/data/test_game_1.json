  "overview": "In this dynamic encounter featuring a Reversed Grünfeld structure (Zukertort Setup), White (Ding Liren) and Black (Gukesh D) contested central and queenside space early on. Ding aimed for a flexible fianchetto and central control, while Gukesh responded with active counterplay, opening lines on the queenside and maintaining tension in the center. Over time, Black’s precise moves and well-timed transitions into a favorable endgame gave him a decisive edge, culminating in a breakthrough on White’s king position. Ultimately, White could not hold the position, resulting in a 0-1 victory for Gukesh.",
  "keyMoments": [
    "1) Black’s early ...c5 and ...d5 effectively challenged White’s center, preventing Ding from easily consolidating his advantage.",
    "2) The knight maneuvers (Nb5, Nc3, etc.) created tension around d4-c4, but Gukesh’s timely exchanges and bishop deployment stifled White’s pressure.",
    "3) Black’s queenside expansion with ...b5 and ...a6 opened lines at the right moment, giving Gukesh the initiative.",
    "4) The transition to the endgame, where Black’s active king and rook created unstoppable threats, sealed White’s fate."
